# Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
# Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.
# For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’. 

# Orginal String is  pynative
# Printing only even index chars
# p
# n
# t
# v

#Pseudocode 

# Let the user input string 
user_string = input("Input string: ")

# Create a len function to calculate the length of the inputted string 
length_string = len(user_string)

# Print the first message
print("Origital String is",user_string)

# Print the second message 
print("Printing only even index chars")

# Create a loop
